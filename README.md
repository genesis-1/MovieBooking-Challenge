# MovieBooking-Challenge
Your project is to take the api  described below and use .net core api and Blazor to  to simulate a cinema booking and retrieval of booking exercise.

A live working example, can be found at www.movies-at.ie.

You will store the bookings in an In-Memory database and Caching, retrieve and replicate them on the screen. You have up to 14 days to complete the project and you should focus on submitting it sooner rather than later! Speed of delivery will be taken into account. If you believe you need more time, that will be granted.

This is a mock api for a list of movies in a cinema: https://XXXXXXX.herokuapp.com/. Note that it takes about 30 seconds to 'wake' up as it is on a sleeping heroku server.
